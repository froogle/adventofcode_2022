# adventofcode_2022
For this year's Advent of Code I decided I wanted to tackle all the puzzles with Swift. 

My solutions aren't going to be the fastest, nor are they intended to be an example of code-golf. This is just me building up my fluency with Swift, exploring language features and using a set of well defined problems to target my learning.
